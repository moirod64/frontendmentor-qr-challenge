## My process

1.- Making Body Flexbox and centering all items.
2.- Added border to main section containing card for visibility and stablishing fixed width.
3.- Added style/centered all components within card and stylized fonts.
4.- Added box-shadow for card and finished stylizing fonts to match design refference.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Continue to focus on improving CSS skills.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs for CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me recap on some styles I missed to remember on styling border box.
